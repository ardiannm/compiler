# test case for switching operators within parenthesized expressions before removing parenthesis tokens

-(1-2)+3+4-(5-6-7)      
-(1-2)+3+4--(5-6-7)     
-(1-2)+3+4+-(5-6-7)     # 1+2+3+4+5+6+7

# this leads to the necessity to have a method that turns a tree back into a string
# else the equality of the two can be proven by checking both nodes ids using ObjectId
# id of rewriten "-(1-2)+3+4+-(5-6-7)" should be the same to the object id of "1+2+3+4+5+6+7"
# and indeed "c90f367a" is the same for both but this also leads to the necessity of writing tests
